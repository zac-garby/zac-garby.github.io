Our project for *AstonHack7*. Enter your bits into the Hyper Mainframe Interface,
and watch the Rotational Actuation Manifold whizz up. Observe the spinning
Quantum Rotational Code, and the buzz of the Autonomous Chromatic Semaphore. The
flashing eye of the Imaging Matrix will aggregate all of this information, and
send it to the Bio-informatic Terminal for your very own eyes to read. It's just
like magic!

In other words... What's the most silly way to transmit a few bits of data? We
think this project is just that. With a spinning QR code ("one" on one side and
"zero" on the other); a servo-based semaphore system; and, many others, the
Whimsical Transmission Apparatus is a monster of a project which attempts to
send data from one breadboard to another in the least efficient way possible.

This project was really great fun, maybe one of my favourite of all the
hackathons I've been to. Also, since we weren't allowed to solder, a lot of the
connections were made by twisting split-pins around wires, which was... fun. This
was made by me, James, Jacob, and Oli.
