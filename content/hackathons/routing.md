*Routing* was my first hackathon project ever! It was at *HackNotts 2019*, of
course, and at the time I didn't really have a clue what a hackathon was or
what to make for one.

I was in my first year of Computer Science at the time, and we'd just had a few
lectures on packet routing around the internet, so I figured I'd make a game
based somehow on that. The idea is that the player builds up routing tables
over time, connecting the devices together as they join the network and
instructing the packets what their "next hop" should be.

It's actually kinda fun. I ended up making it in Lua actually, using the
*love2d* library, and as such my main hurdle was... Lua itself. Annoyingly, if
I'd used Haskell (as I was originally planning), I'd have won the *Haskell
Prize*, since nobody else entered the category. Either way, good fun. Do have a
look at the slightly longer writeup on [my Devpost](https://devpost.com/software/routing).
